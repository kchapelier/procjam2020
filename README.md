# SMB3 Procedural ROM Hack

https://www.kchapelier.com/procjam2020-smb3/

Revisit one of the most classic NES/FC game with this procedural ROM hack replacing the worldmaps of Super Mario Bros. 3 with a procedurally generated map. Each generation will yield a different world and will provide an opportunity to play lesser-played levels usually bypassed by the use of whistles in the original game.

The process is exclusively client-side, the provided ROM is not uploaded to any server, and the script exclusively contains original code and content. All trademarks, service marks and company names are the property of their respective owners.

This project was made for [PROCJAM 2020](http://www.procjam.com/).
